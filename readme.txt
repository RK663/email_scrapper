###Email scraping is based on google custom search json api.

###Google custom search json api has some limitation. You can't search more than 10 times at a day from a api key in this app.

###When a api will limit exceeded then you will get a alert to change the api key from filter.

###When all api key will exceeded then you may create new one from https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview then paste it to custom api key.

###You may change the search site from filter. By default there set to instagram.com

###You may set limitation from filter. If you set 200 as limit then you can use the api key 5 times a day. ( 1 api key = total 10 times per day for 100 result).
